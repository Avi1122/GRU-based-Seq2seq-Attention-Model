<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Attention Based GRU Encoder Decoder for Flood Prediction][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Avi1122/GRU-based-Seq2seq-Attention-Model)

The aim of this research is to develop a neural-network-based predictive model for flood forecasts. The specific aims include:
<ol>

<li>Designing proper recurrent neural network architectures with the state-of-art techniques in the AI and ML community;</li>
<li>Comparing the developed models with the existing work in literature for flood forecast;</li>
<li>Studying the effects of partially selected input features on flood forecast for scalability reduction.</li>
</ol>

As illustrated in the above picture, We use Attention Based GRU Encoder Decoder networks for predicting streamflow forecast at a particlular sub-basin using the fucture and past knowledge of upstream sub-basin properties.

### Built With

The major frameworks that we used to built our project are:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs)
- [Keras](https://keras.io)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

<p>
Our work environment includes: <br />
cuda 11.4 <br />
gcc  9.4.0 <br />
cudnn_version 8 <br />
Nvidia driver 510.47.03 <br />
2 x Quadro RTX 8000 GPU machines <br />
anaconda3/2021.05 <br />

However, feel free to try different combinations using this [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations) guide which hints the tensorflow conpatibility. Assuming that you have a working combination of the prerequisites,
<br />

</p>
1.We suggest you to start with a new conda environment. Say,

```sh
conda create --name flood_prediction python=3.8
```

2.Activate the environment using

```sh
conda activate flood_prediction
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Avi1122/GRU-based-Seq2seq-Attention-Model.git
```

2. Install dependency packages using the _requirements.txt_ file attached in this repo using

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

We created a sample dataset _masterdf2.csv_ and 2 scipts.

<ul>
<li><em>runoff.sh</em> used for training a model which would be stored in a folder algin with intermidiary outputs. </li>
<li><em>runoff_pred.sh</em> uses the stored model to predict the streamflow at the given sub-basin for a test set</li>
</ul>

Make sure that the shell scripts in the repo have necessary permisions to execute.

```sh
chmod +x runoff.sh
```

and <br />

```sh
chmod +x runoff_pred.sh
```

To train the model use the following script.<br />

```sh
./runoff.sh
```

To predict outcome for sample inputs, use the following script.<br />

```sh
./runoff_pred.sh
```

However, If you need help in changing the arguments of the python file, the help section for both the python files is as follows.<br />

```sh
python Final_api.py -h
```

or <br />

```sh
python Predict_api.py -h
```
